In this project:
diskinfo is to get details of <INPUT_FILE>;
disklist is to get files and directories in the root directory of <INPUT_FILE>;
diskget is to get <FILENAME> from root directory into local directory of <INPUT_FILE>
diskput is to put <FILENAME> from local directory into root directory of <INPUT_FILE>



--------------------------------------------
To compile: make
To run:

./diskinfo <INPUT FILE>
./disklist <INPUT FILE>
./diskget  <INPUT FILE> <FILENAME>
./diskput  <INPUT FILE> <FILENAME>


Note: I didn't finish diskput.c, but I wrote out all of the functions I needed.
